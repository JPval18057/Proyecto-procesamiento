# Signal Processing App
This project was about developing an application mainly for windows 10 systems, capable of adding effects to the desired music track.
One of the primary requirements was to be easy to use, for that reason the GUI was focused on simplicity.
To use this app the user has to open the file with Matlab, next load in the song via a windows explorer pop up, and finally select the effects for each of the channels in case the song has that feature.

Main tasks for the proyect:
1. Design the difference equation per filter
2. Test each one with a sample song
3. Make the GUI using Matlab's helper
4. Debug the GUI and make sure the base functionality works properly
5. Add the difference equations
6. Test each channel of the sample track
7. Test with multiple tracks
8. Verify the quality factor of each filter
